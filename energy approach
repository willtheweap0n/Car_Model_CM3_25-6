"""
fuel consumption is the same as energy in to car. energy in to travel given segment is 
work done against resistance forces.
To use equation code must test build a gradient of a slope and a horizontal distance L, then test
a range of speeds to optimise for the smallest E_fuel for that segment.
E_fuel = (L*(C_rr*m*g + 0.5*rho*C_d*v^2) + m*g*deltaz)/nth(v). nth(v)= nth_engine*nth_drivetrain
which can be found at speeds in BSFC map. not sure how to give this bsfc map to code though.
